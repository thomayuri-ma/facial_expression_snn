# facial_expression_snn
Implements a hybrid CNN-SNN model for FER using the EfficientNet-B0 backbone and a two-layer SNN classifier. It leverages advanced training techniques like AdamW optimizer, label smoothing, and an EMA model to improve performance and generalization. The code also includes visualization tools like a confusion matrix.
