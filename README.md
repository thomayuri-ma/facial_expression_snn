This project implements a hybrid CNN–SNN model for Facial Expression Recognition (FER).
It uses EfficientNet-B0 as the feature extractor and a two-layer Spiking Neural Network (SNN) as the classifier.

**Features**

- EfficientNet-B0 backbone for strong feature extraction

- Two-layer SNN head with spiking neuron dynamics

- Modern training tricks: AdamW, label smoothing, EMA model

- Evaluation tools: accuracy, confusion matrix, visual outputs
